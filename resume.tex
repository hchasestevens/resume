\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
\item Served as tech lead for 12-person Data Science group; liaised directly with clients
\item Architected core machine learning training and serving platform atop AWS SageMaker, allowing rapid prototyping with CI/CD (see ``Conferences")
\item Genericized and adapted existing Scala-based automated bidding technology to new advertising products, directly enabling over \$1m/yr in additional revenue
\end{itemize}
\textit{Software Engineer} at \textbf{Curata, Inc.} \hfill April 2017 - November 2017
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
\item As part of Research and Development division, leveraged NLP, ML, and optimization techniques in ideating, prototyping, developing, and productionizing new analytics features using Jupyter Notebooks, nltk, spaCy, and d3.js.
\item Redeveloped and improved performance of critical Python ETL systems, in one instance bringing user-facing requests from 3 minutes to under 5 seconds.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Software Engineer} at \textbf{Skyscanner, Ltd.} \hfill May 2013 - February 2017
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
\item Performed business-critical operations for Sequoia-Capital-backed startup up to and during \$1.7bn exit; produced codebase audit requisite to acquisition 
\item Maintained and developed highly-available, service-vital web scraping and deep-linking platform and associated Python framework, parsing over 10 GB/s of data to serve more than 5000 requests/second
\item Delivered NLP/ML-based tool for automatic point-and-click web scraper generation
\item Proposed and authored Selenium WebDriver-based web scraper framework in Python
\item Created AST-based tooling allowing real-time analysis, manipulation, generation, and automated quality assurance of code in multi-million line legacy Python codebase
\end{itemize}
